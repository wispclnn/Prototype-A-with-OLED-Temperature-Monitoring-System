# Prototype-A-with-OLED-Temperature-Monitoring-System
Prototype A with OLED is a simple temperature monitoring system using a DHT11 sensor. It displays real-time temperature readings and status messages on an OLED screen while using red and green LEDs to indicate hot and cool conditions based on a predefined threshold. This prototype provides an easy-to-read, standalone visual indicator.
